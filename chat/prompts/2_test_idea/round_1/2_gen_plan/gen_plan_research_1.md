<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Tiny Router Picks Greedy or Sampling
hypothesis: >-
  A simple supervised classifier trained on prompt embeddings can learn to predict whether greedy or sampling decoding will
  produce the correct answer for a given prompt, and using this classifier to route each prompt to its predicted optimal strategy
  yields higher accuracy than using either strategy alone.
motivation: >-
  Current approaches to adaptive decoding use reinforcement learning or complex policies that require online interaction with
  the model. We propose a simpler, more interpretable approach: precompute which decoding strategy works best for each prompt
  using ground truth labels, then train a tiny supervised classifier to predict this choice from the prompt embedding. This
  approach is orders of magnitude simpler than RL-based methods, requires no online interaction, and provides a clear information-theoretic
  justification: prompt embeddings contain sufficient information about task type to determine optimal decoding strategy.
assumptions:
- >-
  Prompt embeddings contain sufficient information to distinguish prompts that benefit from greedy vs sampling decoding
- >-
  The optimal decoding strategy for a prompt is consistent across multiple runs (i.e., greedy is reliably better for some
  prompts, sampling for others)
- >-
  A simple classifier (linear or small MLP) can capture the mapping from prompt embeddings to optimal decoding strategy
- >-
  Ground truth labels for 'which strategy works better' can be obtained by running both strategies and checking correctness
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Create a dataset of prompts with oracle labels: for each prompt, run both greedy and sampling decoding (multiple samples
  for sampling), determine which strategy produces the correct answer more often. 2. Extract prompt embeddings using a frozen
  LLM. 3. Train a simple binary classifier (logistic regression or 2-layer MLP) to predict 'greedy is better' vs 'sampling
  is better' from the prompt embedding. 4. Evaluate on held-out prompts: use the classifier to route each prompt to its predicted
  strategy, compare against always-greedy and always-sampling baselines. 5. Analyze what prompt features the classifier uses
  (task type, complexity, etc.).
success_criteria: >-
  The router-classified approach should achieve higher accuracy than the best single strategy (greedy or sampling) on held-out
  prompts. Specifically, if greedy achieves X% accuracy and sampling achieves Y% accuracy on a test set, the router should
  achieve > max(X, Y)% accuracy. Additionally, the router should outperform random routing (50/50 split between strategies)
  and simple heuristics (e.g., route based on prompt length or perplexity).
related_works:
- >-
  Learning Adaptive LLM Decoding (arXiv:2603.09065): Uses RL with verifiable rewards to learn adaptive decoding policies.
  Our approach differs by using supervised learning with precomputed oracle labels instead of RL, and using a much simpler
  classifier instead of a learned adapter.
- >-
  Adaptive Decoding via Latent Preference Optimization (arXiv:2411.09661): Uses latent preference optimization to learn temperature
  adaptation. Our approach differs by framing the problem as binary classification (greedy vs sampling) with supervised labels,
  not continuous temperature adjustment via LPO.
- >-
  Collab: Controlled Decoding using Mixture of Agents (arXiv:2503.21720): Uses multiple LLM agents with token-level switching.
  Our approach differs by using a single model with two decoding strategies and a simple prompt-level router, not multiple
  models.
- >-
  Mixture of Decoding (ACL 2025): Uses attention-based dynamic adaptation for vision-language models. Our approach differs
  by using supervised learning on prompt embeddings rather than attention-based heuristics, and focusing on the simpler binary
  greedy-vs-sampling decision.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis draws inspiration from three sources: (1) Model routing in multi-LLM systems, where simple classifiers route
  prompts to appropriate models based on task difficulty; (2) Minimum Description Length principle from information theory,
  which suggests that different tasks have different optimal compression strategies (analogous to decoding strategies); (3)
  Linear probing literature, which shows that prompt embeddings contain rich information about task type that can be extracted
  with simple classifiers.
terms:
- term: Decoding strategy
  definition: >-
    The algorithm used to select the next token when generating text from a language model, such as greedy decoding (always
    pick highest probability token) or sampling (randomly pick from top tokens).
- term: Prompt embedding
  definition: >-
    A vector representation of the input prompt produced by the language model, typically from the last hidden state or pooled
    output, that captures semantic information about the prompt.
- term: Oracle label
  definition: >-
    The ground truth label indicating which decoding strategy (greedy or sampling) produces the correct answer for a given
    prompt, determined by actually running both strategies and checking correctness.
- term: Router
  definition: >-
    A small model or classifier that decides which strategy or model to use for a given input, in this case choosing between
    greedy and sampling decoding.
- term: Greedy decoding
  definition: >-
    A deterministic decoding strategy that always selects the token with the highest probability at each step.
- term: Sampling decoding
  definition: >-
    A stochastic decoding strategy that randomly samples from the probability distribution over tokens (possibly truncated
    to top-k or top-p tokens).
summary: >-
  A simple supervised classifier can learn to predict whether greedy or sampling decoding will work better for a given prompt
  based on its embedding, and routing prompts to their predicted optimal strategy beats using either strategy alone.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: research_iter1_dir1
type: research
objective: >-
  Survey adaptive decoding methods and identify suitable QA datasets for generating oracle labels
approach: >-
  Research existing adaptive decoding approaches, understand how oracle labels for decoding strategy selection have been constructed
  in prior work, and identify datasets with prompts that have clear correct answers (multiple-choice QA, math word problems,
  etc.) that would enable us to verify correctness of greedy vs sampling outputs.
depends_on: []
</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

name: aii-json
description: JSON validation and formatting toolkit. Validate JSON files against schemas for experiment pipelines, and generate full/mini/preview versions of JSON datasets. Use for validating pipeline outputs, checking schema compliance, or creating size-optimized JSON variants.
---

## Contents

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Hypothesis Selection & Evaluation:**
- `sel_hypo_out.json` - Hypothesis Selection output (all hypotheses with selected flags)
- `feasibility_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with feasibility scores
- `feasibility_eval_top.json` - Top 5 most feasible hypotheses
- `novelty_research_one.json` - Single hypothesis novelty research arguments with citations
- `novelty_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with novelty scores
- `novelty_eval_top.json` - Single best selected hypothesis

**Experiment Pipeline:**
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format

---

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
````
